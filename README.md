# airpollution_deeplearning
Deep learning for prediction of air pollution trend for four monitoring stations in Delhi, India. 

The experiments feature different deep learning models such as FNN and LSTM based models. 
The experiments also feature multivariate and univariate analysis using different training strategies 
with Bi-LSTM model (best) for multistep ahead prediction of PM2.5 values. The experiments further provide one month
ahead forecast of PM2.5 values with uncertainty quantification.

## Code
We have a unified code for all four stations with proper comments.
